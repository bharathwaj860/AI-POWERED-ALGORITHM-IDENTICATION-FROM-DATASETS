# AI-POWERED-ALGORITHM-IDENTICATION-FROM-DATASETS
This project aims to automate the selection of the most suitable Machine Learning algorithm for any given dataset using AI-driven meta-learning techniques. Instead of manually experimenting with multiple models, the system analyzes dataset characteristics and recommends the best-fit algorithm for classification, regression, or clustering tasks.
